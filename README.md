.tmux
=====

Self-contained, pretty and versatile `.tmux.conf` configuration file.

Installation
------------

Requirements:

  - tmux **`>= 2.1`** (soon `>= 2.4`) running inside Linux, Mac, OpenBSD, Cygwin
    or WSL
  - awk, perl and sed
  - outside of tmux, `$TERM` must be set to `xterm-256color`

To install, run the following from your terminal: (you may want to backup your
existing `~/.tmux.conf` first)

```
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/barimehdi77/.tmux.git
$ ln -s -f .tmux/.tmux.conf
$ cp .tmux/.tmux.conf.local .
```

ðŸ’¡ You can clone the repository anywhere you want, provided you create the
proper `~/.tmux.conf` symlink and you copy the `.tmux.conf.local` sample file in
your home directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/barimehdi77/.tmux.git
$ ln -s -f /path/to/oh-my-tmux/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
$ cp /path/to/oh-my-tmux/.tmux.conf.local ~/.tmux.conf.local
```

Then proceed to [customize] your `~/.tmux.conf.local` copy.

[customize]: #configuration

If you're a Vim user, setting the `$EDITOR` environment variable to `vim` will
enable and further customize the vi-style key bindings (see tmux manual).

If you're new to tmux, I recommend you read [tmux 2: Productive Mouse-Free
Development][bhtmux2] by [@bphogan].

Troubleshooting
---------------

 - **I'm running tmux `HEAD` and things don't work properly. What should I do?**

   Please open an issue describing what doesn't work with upcoming tmux. I'll do
   my best to address it.

 - **Status line is broken and/or gets duplicated at the bottom of the screen.
   What gives?**

   This particularly happens on Linux when the distribution provides a version
   of glib that received Unicode 9.0 upgrades (glib `>= 2.50.1`) while providing
   a version of glibc that didn't (glibc `< 2.26`). You may also configure
   `LC_CTYPE` to use an `UTF-8` locale. Typically VTE based terminal emulators
   rely on glib's `g_unichar_iswide()` function while tmux relies on glibc's
   `wcwidth()` function. When these two functions disagree, display gets messed
   up.

   This can also happen on macOS when using iTerm2 and "Use Unicode version 9
   character widths" is enabled in `Preferences... > Profiles > Text`

   For that reason, the default `~/.tmux.conf.local` file stopped using Unicode
   characters for which width changed in between Unicode 8.0 and 9.0 standards,
   as well as Emojis.

 - **I installed Powerline and/or (patched) fonts but can't see Powerline
   symbols.**

   First, you don't need to install Powerline. You only need fonts patched with
   Powerline symbols or the standalone `PowerlineSymbols.otf` font. Then make
   sure your `~/.tmux.conf.local` copy uses the right code points for
   `tmux_conf_theme_left_separator_XXX` values.

 - **I'm using Bash On Windows (WSL), colors and Powerline look are broken.**

   There is currently a [bug][1681] in the new console powering Bash On Windows
   preventing text attributes (bold, underscore, ...) to combine properly with
   colors. The workaround is to search your `~/.tmux.conf.local` copy and
   replace attributes with `'none'`.

   Also, until Window's console replaces its GDI based render with a DirectWrite
   one, Powerline symbols will be broken.

   The alternative is to use the [Mintty terminal for WSL][wsltty].

[Urlview]: https://packages.debian.org/stable/misc/urlview

The "maximize any pane to a new window with `<prefix> +`" feature is different
from builtin `resize-pane -Z` as it allows you to further split a maximized
pane. It's also more flexible by allowing you to maximize a pane to a new
window, then change window, then go back and the pane is still in maximized
state in its own window. You can then minimize a pane by using `<prefix> +`
either from the source window or the maximized window.

Mouse mode allows you to set the active window, set the active pane, resize
panes and automatically switches to copy-mode to select text.

Bindings
--------

tmux may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a
prefix key, followed by a command key. This configuration uses `C-a` as a
secondary prefix while keeping `C-b` as the default prefix. In the following
list of key bindings:
  - `<prefix>` means you have to either hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd>
  - `<prefix> c` means you have to hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> followed by <kbd>c</kbd>
  - `<prefix> C-c` means you have to hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> followed by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>

This configuration uses the following bindings:

 - `<prefix> e` opens `~/.tmux.conf.local` with the editor defined by the
   `$EDITOR` environment variable (defaults to `vim` when empty)
 - `<prefix> r` reloads the configuration
 - `C-l` clears both the screen and the tmux history

 - `<prefix> C-c` creates a new session
 - `<prefix> C-f` lets you switch to another session by name

 - `<prefix> C-h` and `<prefix> C-l` let you navigate windows (default
   `<prefix> n` and `<prefix> p` are unbound)
 - `<prefix> Tab` brings you to the last active window

 - `<prefix> -` splits the current pane vertically
 - `<prefix> |` splits the current pane horizontally
 - `<prefix> right-arrow`, `<prefix> left-arrow`, `<prefix> up-arrow` and `<prefix> down-arrow` let you navigate
   panes ala Vim
 - `<prefix> alt+right-arrow`, `<prefix> alt+left-arrow`, `<prefix> alt+up-arrow`, `<prefix> alt+down-arrow` let you resize panes
 - `<prefix> <` and `<prefix> >` let you swap panes
 - `<prefix> +` maximizes the current pane to a new window

 - `<prefix> m` toggles mouse mode on or off

 - `<prefix> U` launches Urlview (if available)
 - `<prefix> F` launches Facebook PathPicker (if available)

 - `<prefix> Enter` enters copy-mode
 - `<prefix> b` lists the paste-buffers
 - `<prefix> p` pastes from the top paste-buffer
 - `<prefix> P` lets you choose the paste-buffer to paste from

Bindings for `copy-mode-vi`:

- `v` begins selection / visual mode
- `C-v` toggles between blockwise visual mode and visual mode
- `H` jumps to the start of line
- `L` jumps to the end of line
- `y` copies the selection to the top paste-buffer
- `Escape` cancels the current operation

Configuration
-------------

While this configuration tries to bring sane default settings, you may want to
customize it further to your needs. Instead of altering the `~/.tmux.conf` file
and diverging from upstream, the proper way is to edit the `~/.tmux.conf.local`
file.

Please refer to the sample `.tmux.conf.local` file to know more about variables
you can adjust to alter different behaviors. Pressing `<prefix> e` will open
`~/.tmux.conf.local` with the editor defined by the `$EDITOR` environment
variable (defaults to `vim` when empty).

### Enabling the Powerline look

Powerline originated as a status-line plugin for Vim. Its popular eye-catching
look is based on the use of special symbols: <img width="80" alt="Powerline Symbols" style="vertical-align: middle;" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/553208/10687156/1b76dda6-796b-11e5-83a1-1634337c4571.png" />

To make use of these symbols, there are several options:

- use a font that already bundles those: this is e.g. the case of the
  [2.030R-ro/1.050R-it version][source code pro] of the Source Code Pro font
- use a [pre-patched font][powerline patched fonts]
- use your preferred font along with the [Powerline font][powerline font] (that
  only contains the Powerline symbols): [this highly depends on your operating
  system and your terminal emulator][terminal support], for instance here's a
  screenshot of iTerm2 configured to use `PowerlineSymbols.otf`
